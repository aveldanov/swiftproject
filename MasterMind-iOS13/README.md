#  MASTERMIND by Anton Veldanov

## The Goal

Implement a mastermind game, which can be played by a user "against" the computer.
This game where a player tries to guess the number combinations.
At the end of each attempt to guess the 4 number combinations, the computer will provide feedback whether the player had guess a number correctly, or/and a number and digit correctly.
A player must guess
    the right number combinations within 10 attempts to win the game.
    
    
    
    ## What I created
    
    In the app I created the game's logic in a separate file first. Also the visual storyboard was created separately
